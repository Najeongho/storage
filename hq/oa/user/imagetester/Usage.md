To apply specific permissions to a newly created "imagetester" user using `qwalk.py` from the Qumulo filesystem walk repository, you can follow these steps. This will ensure that the user has the appropriate permissions set for the "testimagedata" directory and all its subdirectories and files on a Windows OS SMB-mounted 'Z' drive.

1. **Download the repository**:
   - Clone the repository from GitHub:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Qumulo/qumulo-filesystem-walk.git
     ```
   - Navigate into the directory:
     ```bash
     cd qumulo-filesystem-walk
     ```

2. **Set up your environment**:
   - Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You might need to install the `qumulo-api` package:
     ```bash
     pip install qumulo-api
     ```

3. **Create a custom task for applying ACLs**:
   - Create a new Python file, e.g., `apply_role_acl.py`, inside the `qtasks` directory:
     ```python
     from qumulo.rest_client import RestClient

     class ApplyRoleACL:
         def __init__(self, in_args):
             pass

         @staticmethod
         def apply_acl(rc, path):
             # Define the desired ACL based on the specific role
             role_acl = [
                 {
                     "principal": "user:imagetester",
                     "permissions": ["fs_read_data", "fs_write_data", "fs_append_data", "fs_read_attr", "fs_write_attr", "fs_read_xattr", "fs_write_xattr", "fs_execute", "fs_read_acl", "fs_write_acl", "fs_write_owner", "fs_synchronize"],  # Adjust the permissions as needed for the role
                     "principal_type": "user"
                 }
             ]
             rc.fs.set_acl_v2(path=path, acl={'acl': role_acl})

         def every_batch(self, file_list, work_obj):
             for file_info in file_list:
                 self.apply_acl(work_obj.rc, file_info['path'])

         @staticmethod
         def work_start(work_obj):
             pass

         @staticmethod
         def work_done(work_obj):
             pass
     ```

4. **Edit `qwalk.py` to include your custom task**:
   - Open `qwalk.py` and add your custom task to the `QTASKS` dictionary:
     ```python
     from qtasks.apply_role_acl import ApplyRoleACL

     QTASKS = {
         # ... other tasks ...
         'ApplyRoleACL': ApplyRoleACL,
     }
     ```

5. **Run the `qwalk.py` script**:
   - Now you can run the `qwalk.py` script specifying the new task `ApplyRoleACL` to walk through the directory and apply the ACLs:
     ```bash
     python qwalk.py -s <QUMULO_HOSTNAME> -u <USERNAME> -p <PASSWORD> -d /testimagedata -c ApplyRoleACL -g
     ```
   Replace `<QUMULO_HOSTNAME>`, `<USERNAME>`, and `<PASSWORD>` with your actual Qumulo cluster details.

This script will walk through the "testimagedata" directory and apply the specified ACL recursively to all subdirectories and files. The `apply_role_acl.py` script ensures that the "imagetester" user has the desired role-based permissions set for each file and directory.
